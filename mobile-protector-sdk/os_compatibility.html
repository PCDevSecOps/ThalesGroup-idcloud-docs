<h1 id="mobile-os-compatibility">Mobile OS compatibility</h1>
<p>As Thales Protector OATH SDK supports different operating systems, the compatibility of every mobile operating system (OS) update is tested with the latest Protector OATH SDK version. </p>
<h2 id="mobile-operating-system-versions">Mobile operating system versions</h2>
<p>The versioning of each mobile OS release is defined using a three-part version number: major version; minor version; and patch.</p>
<p>Where:  </p>
<ul>
<li>The major number is incremented when new functionalities are integrated into the OS.</li>
<li>The minor number is incremented each time new minor features are integrated into the OS.</li>
<li>The patch number is incremented when minor changes and bug fixes are made.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="note">Note</h3>
<p>The exact version numbering of each OS is defined by the respective mobile OS providers and is subject to changes.</p>
<p>Typically, beta versions of the mobile OS are published ahead of the actual launch to allow application developers to test the compatibility of their applications on the mobile OS. </p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of published beta versions and the dates they are published before the actual release are dependent from the mobile OS provider strategy. </li>
<li>The exact publication date of the actual release is not disclosed by mobile OS providers as this depends on the feedbacks received from the beta releases.</li>
</ul>
